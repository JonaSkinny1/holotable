# Flip 7 · Helios · Reactor Overload · Sabacc · MANIFEST

Python **Flip 7** rules engine plus a **Helios** five-station holotable web UI. The app stays the Holotable. The **REACTOR** station is a multiplayer table with a **game picker**: **Reactor Overload** (Flip 7 reskin), **Sabacc** (simplified Corellian Spike–inspired house rules), or **MANIFEST** (original goods game). Private datapads drive the active game.

Software only in this repo — no physical Pepper’s Ghost hardware, actuators, or MQTT.

**Sabacc disclaimer:** fan/home private-table house rules only. **Not a licensed Lucasfilm product.**

## Helios vs Reactor

| Layer | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Helios** | Ground-station shell on the public holotable: **WEATHER · NAV · REACTOR · BIO · COMMS** (keys `1`–`5`). Black / teal / hazard chrome for Pepper’s Ghost demos (**Ohio Outpost // Sol-3** / Ohio ground-station flavor). |
| **Reactor Overload** | Full Flip 7 game on the REACTOR station: real `flip7` deck & scoring, Containment Lock / Overcharge Pulse / Neutralizer Shield labels, race to **200**. |
| **Sabacc** | Second REACTOR game: +/- cards, goal near **0**, bomb-out if \|sum\| > 23, race to **100**. Switch via the on-table game picker (or `POST /api/game`). |
| **MANIFEST** | Third REACTOR game. Original. Sell one hand card, name it, buyer pays 2. Optional look for 1. Highest coins + market after 8 rounds, or when the table ends the game. |
| **Other stations** | Polished **MOCK** stubs (solar/Kp, Earth/ISS orbit, vials SP-01–SP-08, frequency dial). Live APIs optional later. |

## Run — terminal Flip 7

```bash
python3 -m flip7
python3 -m flip7 --players 4
```

## Run — Helios holotable server

```bash
python3 -m flip7.server
# optional: --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8766 --players 3 --game sabacc
```

Then open:

```
# public Helios table (stations 1–5; REACTOR = live game picker)
http://127.0.0.1:8766/
http://127.0.0.1:8766/index.html#REACTOR
http://127.0.0.1:8766/public.html          # redirects to #REACTOR

# private datapads (one tab/device per seat)
http://127.0.0.1:8766/pad.html?seat=0
http://127.0.0.1:8766/pad.html?seat=1
```

Sync: **WebSocket** `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/ws?role=table|pad&seat=N` with REST fallback (`GET /api/state`, `POST /api/hit|stay|new|game`).

### Solo with computer opponents

1. Start the Helios server (optionally with bots at boot):
   ```bash
   python3 -m flip7.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8766
   # or: python3 -m flip7.server --computers 2
   ```
2. Open the public table → **REACTOR**, or your datapad (`pad.html?seat=0`).
3. Tap **Computers: 0 / 1 / 2 / 3** (starts a new match: you = Pilot at seat 0; bots = COSMOS, F.R.A.N.K., Probe-7).
4. Play from **pad seat 0** only — bots auto-act on their turn (no phone pad).

REST: `POST /api/computers` with `{"computers":2}`. WebSocket: `{"type":"set_computers","computers":2}`.

### Switch games

- On the **REACTOR** panel (or datapad): tap **Reactor Overload** or **Sabacc**.
- REST: `POST /api/game` with `{"game":"sabacc"}`, `{"game":"flip7"}`, or `{"game":"manifest"}`.
- WebSocket: `{"type":"set_game","game":"manifest"}`.
- Boot: `python3 -m flip7.server --game sabacc` or `--game manifest`.

### MANIFEST

Original goods game on the same seats and server. No second process. Card faces are `{id, name}` so a picture can replace the label later.

- **Players:** 2–4. Each starts with **5 coins**, **3 face-up market cards**, **3 hand cards**.
- **Goods only:** Helion, plant canisters, books, antiques, star charts.
- **Turn:** sell one card from your hand to another player. Name it before they pay. They pay **2**.
- **Look:** they may pay **1** to look. No look: the sale stands as named. Match: it stands. Miss: the sale fails and the seller pays **3**, or whatever they have.
- **Draw:** the seller draws back to 3. Used cards go back under the deck.
- **Score:** coins + market. One card **2**, a pair **6**, three of a kind **10**. Highest wins after **8** rounds, or when the table ends the game.
- **Side:** merchant, smuggler, pirate, or scavenger — you pick. Nobody is assigned one. It does not change the sale.
- **Pads:** `pad.html?seat=0` and `pad.html?seat=1`. Hands stay on that datapad. The public table shows markets, coins, and the named sale.

REST: `POST /api/sell` `{"seat","card","claim","buyer"}`, `POST /api/look` `{"seat","look":true|false}`, `POST /api/end`, `POST /api/role` `{"seat","role"}`. WebSocket types: `sell`, `look`, `end`, `set_role`.

### Static-only (UI chrome, no engine)

```bash
cd holotable && python3 -m http.server 8766
# public: http://127.0.0.1:8766/public.html
# pad:    http://127.0.0.1:8766/pad.html
```

Without `flip7.server`, pads cannot drive real draws — use the Helios server for play.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Rules — Flip 7 / Reactor Overload (summary)

- Deck: one `0`; card `N` appears `N` times for `N = 1..12`; three each of `SECOND_CHANCE`, `FREEZE`, `FLIP_THREE`.
- Hit draws; duplicate nonzero number **busts** (0) unless Neutralizer Shield (`SECOND_CHANCE`) absorbs once.
- Containment Lock (`FREEZE`) banks numeric score and ends the turn.
- Overcharge Pulse (`FLIP_THREE`) forces three draws.
- Seven unique numbers → `sum + 15` (**Reactor Overload** / Flip 7) and end the turn.
- First to **200** wins.

## Rules — Sabacc (Helios house / Spike-inspired)

Fan/home private table — **not** a Lucasfilm product.

- **Players:** 2–4.
- **Deck:** two copies of each integer from **−10..−1** and **+1..+10**, plus two **Sylop** cards (value **0**). 42 cards.
- **Goal:** end your turn with a hand total as close to **0** as possible (Corellian Spike–inspired).
- **Deal:** two opening cards each turn; then **Draw** (hit) or **Stand** (stay).
- **Bomb-out:** if `|hand total| > 23` after any draw, you bust and score **0** for the turn.
- **Stand scoring:** `24 − |total|` (so exact **0** / Pure Sabacc = **24** points).
- **Match:** first to **100** wins.
- Actions reuse the same datapad Hit / Stay buttons and `/api/hit` · `/api/stay` endpoints.

## Holotable UX (UI pass)

REACTOR table and datapad polish for kiosk / dark-room viewing (no engine changes):

- **Table:** match HUD (game · turn · race target), clearer crew piles with **TURN** badge, higher teal/orange contrast.
- **Pad:** large Hit/Stay targets, **Your turn** banner, help collapsed under details.
- **Game picker:** oversized dual buttons with **ACTIVE** badge; re-tap of current game ignored.

Details: `holotable/BRIDGE.md` (UX notes).

## Architecture

- `flip7/` — Flip 7 (`deck`, `game`, `turn`, `live`) + Sabacc (`sabacc`, `sabacc_live`) + MANIFEST (`manifest`, `manifest_live`) + computer opponents (`bots`) + `server` (stdlib HTTP + WebSocket).
- `holotable/` — Helios static UI (`index.html`, `pad.html`, `css/`, `js/`).
- See `holotable/BRIDGE.md`.

## Roadmap / out of scope here

- [x] Terminal multiplayer rules engine
- [x] Helios five-station shell + Reactor Overload live server
- [x] Sabacc as second REACTOR game + game picker
- [x] MANIFEST as a third REACTOR game on the same Holotable server
- [x] Computer opponents (solo / fill seats; server-driven)
- [ ] Godot 4 table UI / Pepper’s Ghost layout (phase 2)
- [ ] Physical Pepper’s Ghost, Helios station hardware, actuators, MQTT / Home Assistant
- [ ] Live WEATHER / NAV data feeds
